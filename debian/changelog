scim-tables (0.5.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Dutch translations by Ronald Stroethoff.
    - In debian/patches/, create 40_dutch-translation.dpatch based on the PO
      file sent to upstream mailing list, and enable it in 00list.
    - The 40_dutch-translation patch also adds "nl" to ALL_LINGUAS in
      configure.ac and configure.  Fix timestamp skews in debian/rules.
    - Generate po/nl.gmo file before building in debian/rules.  Remove it
      after cleaning the build.

  * Use /usr/lib/scim-1.0/*/ instead of /usr/lib/scim-1.0/1.4.0/ as the module
    installation path, so that binNMU is possible when SCIM's module ABI
    changes.
